                    Goa is one of the most beautiful places in India situated in the western coast of Arabian Sea. Baga Beach Is A Great Beach. Ibis Style Hotel Experience Is Great. Catching up the sunset in the scenic beaches, holding up the hands of your loved one, taking a long relaxed walk on the sands and of course, not to forget about indulging in some rich sea food, it is a pure bliss! What more can you ask for on a holiday??? Goa is the perfect destination for people of all the age.

                  <p class="text-muted" id="mahab">
                    This place has everything to enjoy with friends, family. Mountains, Tourist Points, Lake and good options available to have food. Lots of hotels to choose for stay. Do visit Pratapghad fort. Worth to visit Mapro food park and Mala's factory.
                    Climate in summer is pleasant but definitely to try to visit post monsoon to experience to winter in this amazing and beautiful place. A combine package to visit Panchgani, Mahabaleshwar and Pratapghad fort will be ideal.

            <p>I have no words about this movie.Harry, Ron and Hermione race against time to destroy the remaining Horcruxes. Meanwhile, the students and teachers unite to defend Hogwarts against Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters. I just say it is one of the best movie  I ever saw in my whole life. There's no doubt that J.K Rowling is one of the best writter and imagineer in the world. The 19 years later scene, Dumbledore's entry in Harry's dream scene, Voldemort's death scene, fight between Hogwarts and Voldemort's army scene, Sirius', James', Lily's, Remus' scene when Harry was going to sacrifice himself to save Hogwarts scene, Snape's memory scene, etc were the best scenes from the movie. There's no doubt J.K Rowling's imagination, Daniel Radcliffe's acting etc made this movie and there's also no doubt that Harry Potter series is one of the best films series of the world. U will have to watch other Harry Potter movies or u will lose 50% of story and fun. I Will Give This Movie 5 Out Of 5 Stars. #Blockbuster #Wellmade #Superdirection #Great Acting</p> </div>

            <p>Star racecar Lightning McQueen and his friend Mater journey abroad to participate in a Grand Prix race. The path to the championship becomes troublesome when Mater gets involved in espionage.
              This is one of the most interesting and unique sequels that you've ever made for a movie, and for once it didn't take you forever. I get why you people hate this film because it's a spy movie and not a racing movie like Cars 1 and 3, but that doesn't make it terrible. I love how Mater becomes the main character in this movie and must uncover the villains responsible for the World Grand Prix being a set up for the popular racers like Lightning, and i also loved the introduction to Holly and Finn going undercover with Mater to expose all the bad guys, and the way he returned after Lightning turned him down was so breath-taking and terrifying (in a good way) with the bomb stuck to his engine. I would appreciate Pixar because this movie because of how amazing it is. It might honestly be my favorite of the Cars series and I Will Give This Movie 5 Out Of 5 Stars. #Blockbuster #Wellmade #Superdirection </p> </div>

            <p>Another Awesome Movie From Marvel.Nice Story Line.Every One Did Justice To Their Roles.Especially Thanos, He Is Really Powerful.The Way He Took Fight On Every Avenger Is Terrific.From Appearance Wise Thor Done Awesome Part In his role Especially his new weapon is rocking.Banner did his role hilariously,the way hulk never come to the light is hilarious.Tony as usually sparked with his new tech and done a tremendous job.some scenes he worked very hard.Captain Is Always Awesome but his screen presence is some what less in my opinion.Doc Strange done justice to his role,in some scenes we can easily see that he is born for this role. Spider man with his new spider tech looks awesome.he took more burden than he can bear.as usually Guardians are joyful,when comes to the action part they are good.Black Panther And His Army Of Wakanda Is Heroic,The Only City That Does not took any damage even after that much big fight is Wakanda WOW.Remaining heroes done justice to their roles.some heroes missed in this movie i don't know why,may be they saved for next movie.All Heroes Done Awesome Work But You Need To Make Your Eyes Wide,To See Every One In One Screen.CGI Work Is Terrific.Every thing is perfect in this Movie.But Climax will melt your heart especially Spidey scene. AWESOME MOVIE.  I Will Give This Movie 5 Out Of 5 Stars. #Blockbuster #Wellmade #Superdirection #Great Acting</p> </div>
